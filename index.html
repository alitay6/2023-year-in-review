            <h2> Unsustainable Global Lifestyle </h2>
            <p> As of 2022, the ecological footprint of the world
                was about 1.75. That means that at our current lifestyle,
                we'd need nearly 2 Earths to support it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item2">
            <p> A great way to counteract these trends is to switch to green
                energy like solar, wind, and hydro power. By switching to
                such renewable energy sources, we won’t run the risk of
                exhausting the natural resources available on Earth, or
                damaging the environment in the process. Switching to green
                energy not only makes the environment healthy, but humanity as well.

            <h2>Earth Overshoot Day </h2>
            <p>Every year, we reach a day when our demand for resources exceeds
                what the Earth is biologically able to generate. This is called
                Earth Overshoot Day. This is calculated by the Global Footprint Network.
                According to them, we use over 75% of what the Earth’s ecosystems can regenerate.
                In 2023, Earth Overshoot Day fell on August 2nd. This day basically signifies the day
                in which the world has used up all the available resources for that entire year.
                Since the 70s, when the first data was available, Overshoot Day has been coming
                earlier and earlier.

        <h3> The Top 5 Green Energy Projects of 2023 </h3>
        <p> List compiled by NES Fircroft, a global energy industry staffing provider. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="one">
        <h2>1. Dogger Bank Wind Farm </h2>
        <p>Located North of England, the Dogger Bank Wind Farm is being built in 3 phases
            and will become the world’s largest offshore wind farm upon its project completion
            in 2026. One single rotation of a wind turbine from this farm can generate enough
            power to completely power a British household for 2 days. Each turbine will be able
            to generate enough power to run 16,000 British households, saving about 9,000
            vehicles worth of emissions. This wind farm is estimated to last 35 years!
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="two">
        <h2>2. Iberdrola Solar Energy Plant </h2>
        <p> Approved in 2023, this solar energy plant will be built in Portugal and will become
            the 5th largest in Europe, 5th globally. Expected to be completed in 2025, the plant
            will generate enough electricity to power 430,000 Portuguese households. With this
            project in motion, the need for fossil fuels decreases, and Portugal’s annual gas
            consumption may be reduced by 370 million cubic meters. Portugal has a goal of
            reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and this project will aid in reaching that.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="three">
        <h2>3. Tyrsky Wind Farm</h2>
        <p>Located off the coast of Finland, the Swedish company OX2 began initial developments
            of the farm this year. The farm is expected to be completed by 2030. The farm will
            have about 100 wind turbines. Tyrsky will be able to generate 6 TWh (terawatt hours)
            a year; a terawatt is one trillion watts. The company OX2 currently has 2 other
            offshore wind farms in Finland, and is planning more. Finland has a goal of reaching
            carbon neutrality by 2035.
        </p>

    <section class="four">
        <h2>4. Yellow Pine Solar</h2>
        <p>Yellow Pine Solar company is under NextEra Energy Resources, the largest wind and
            solar energy producing company in the world. The solar power project will be built
            in Nevada, US and will cover about 3,000 acres of land. While this project is still
            in development as of this year, it’s expected to begin being built in 2024, and
            completed in 2025. It is expected that 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions
            will be offset every year, and will be capable of producing enough clean energy to power
            100,000 American homes.
        </p>

    <section class="five">
        <h2>Delta II Wind Project</h2>
        <p>Under the company Repsol, the Delta II wind project will be an onshore wind farm in
            northeast Spain. The Delta II Project is scheduled for completion in 2023, and will
            consist of 26 wind farms. It is expected to be able to power around 800,000 Spanish
            households and be able to reduce 2.6 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The
            Repsol company aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.

    <section class="Summary">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p class="box">While not all of these projects were put into commission in 2023, the planning, approving,
            building, and all
            stages involved are great steps towards transitioning to green energy across the globe. Not only are these
            projects investing in the future of lowering carbon emissions, but will create many jobs and boost the
            economy. </p>
